    "description": "AWS App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to\nmonitor and control containerized microservices. App Mesh standardizes how your\nmicroservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to\nensure high-availability for your applications.\n\nApp Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every\nmicroservice in an application. You can use App Mesh with Amazon ECS (using the\nAmazon EC2 launch type), Amazon EKS, and Kubernetes on AWS.\n\nApp Mesh supports containerized microservice applications that use service\ndiscovery naming for their components. To use App Mesh, you must have a\ncontainerized application running on Amazon EC2 instances, hosted in either\nAmazon ECS, Amazon EKS, or Kubernetes on AWS. For more information about service\ndiscovery on Amazon ECS, see Service Discovery\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html] \nin the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Kubernetes kube-dns and \ncoredns are supported. For more information, see DNS for Services and Pods\n[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/] in\nthe Kubernetes documentation.",
